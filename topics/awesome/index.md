An awesome list is a list of awesome things curated by the community. There are awesome lists about everything from [CLI applications](https://github.com/agarrha/awesome-cli-apps) to [fantasy books](https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesfantasy). The [main repository](https://github.com/sindresorh/awesome) serves as a curated list of awesome lists.
