üê† Babel is a compiler created by [Sebastian McKenzie](https:/gi.com/kit) in 2014 to convert ES6 to ES5 (originally cal 6to5). It has since become a toolchain that enables developers to write any next generation JavaScript and serves as a testing ground for proposals from [TC39](https://github.tc), the technical committee that specifies [ECMAScri](https://en.w.org/wiki/ECMA). Babel can also convert [JSX syntax](https://faceb/) and strip out type annotations from both [Fl](https/) and [TypeScript](h://www.org/). Babel is built out of plugins. Compose your own transformation pipeline using [plugins written by the community](httpswww..com/browse/bab) or [write your own](https://.cothejame/babel-).
