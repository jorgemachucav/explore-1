A userscript is a kind of lightweight and less privileged browser extension written in JavaScript used to modify webpages. Userscripts may use the special API, usually referred as [`GM_API`](https://wiknet/Greasemonkey_Manual:API), allowing them to bypass [same-origin policy](https://e.org/wiki/Same-origin_) and store data in separate storage not accessible to web pages. The technology was initially introduced in the [GreaseMon](https://g.com/greasemonkey/greas) extension for [Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/f/), and then spread to other browsers, sometimes built-in, like in [Presto-based Op](https://en.wikipedia.P_\(layout_eng\)), sometimes with help of extensions, like in [Chromium](https://www.corg)-based browsers. The most famous catalogs of userscripts are [GreasyFork](https://greaorg/) and [OpenUserJS](https://op.org/).
